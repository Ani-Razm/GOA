                    Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit, and millions already have.

                    Wikipedia's purpose is to benefit readers by presenting information on all branches of knowledge. Hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation,
                    it consists of freely editable content, whose articles also have numerous links to guide readers towards more information.

                    Written collaboratively by largely anonymous volunteers known as Wikipedians, Wikipedia articles can be edited by anyone with Internet access,
                    except in limited cases where editing is restricted to prevent disruption or vandalism.
                    Since its creation on January 15, 2001, it has grown into the world's largest reference website, attracting over a billion visitors monthly.
                    Wikipedia currently has more than sixty-three million articles in more than 300 languages, including 6,850,529 articles in English, with 114,409
                    active contributors in the past month.

                    Wikipedia's fundamental principles are summarized in its five pillars. The Wikipedia community has developed many policies and guidelines, 
                    although editors do not need to be familiar with them before contributing.

                Wikipedia differs from printed references in important ways. It is continually created and updated, and encyclopedic articles on new events appear
                within minutes rather than months or years. Because anyone can improve Wikipedia, it has become more comprehensive than any other encyclopedia.
                Its contributors enhance its articles' quality and quantity, and remove misinformation,
                errors and vandalism. Any reader can fix a mistake or add more information to what has already been written (see Researching with Wikipedia).
