                The guitar is a stringed musical instrument that is usually fretted (with some exceptions) and typically has six or twelve strings.
                It is usually held flat against the player's body and played by strumming or plucking the strings with the dominant hand,
                while simultaneously pressing selected strings against frets with the fingers of the opposite hand. A guitar pick may also
                be used to strike the strings. The sound of the guitar is projected either acoustically,
                by means of a resonant hollow chamber on the guitar, or amplified by an electronic pickup and an amplifier.

                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>
                    The modern word guitar and its antecedents have been applied to a wide variety of chordophones since classical times,
                    sometimes causing confusion. The English word guitar, the German Gitarre, and the French guitare were all adopted from the Spanish guitarra,
                    which comes from the Andalusian Arabic قيثارة (qīthārah)[6] and the Latin cithara, which in turn came from the Ancient Greek κιθάρα. 
                    This Greek word may also come from the Persian word sihtar.[7] 
                    Kithara appears in the Bible four times (1 Cor. 14:7, Rev. 5:8, 14:2, and 15:2), and is usually translated into English as harp.

                The origins of the modern guitar are not known.[8] Before the development of the electric guitar and the use of synthetic materials,
                a guitar was defined as being an instrument having "a long, fretted neck, flat wooden soundboard, ribs, and a flat back,
                most often with incurved sides."[9] The term is used to refer to a number of chordophones that were developed and used across Europe,
                beginning in the 12th century and, later, in the Americas.[10] A 3,300-year-old stone carving of a Hittite bard playing a
                stringed instrument is the oldest iconographic representation of a chordophone,
                and clay plaques from Babylonia show people playing a lute-like instrument which is similar to the guitar.

                Finally, c. 1850, the form and structure of the modern guitar were developed by different Spanish makers such as Manuel de 
                Soto y Solares and, perhaps the most important of all guitar makers, Antonio Torres Jurado, who increased the size of the guitar body,
                altered its proportions, and invented the breakthrough fan-braced pattern. Bracing, the internal pattern of wood reinforcements used to
                secure the guitar's top and back and prevent the instrument from collapsing under tension, is an important factor in how the guitar sounds.
                Torres' design greatly improved the volume,
                tone, and projection of the instrument, and it has remained essentially unchanged since.
